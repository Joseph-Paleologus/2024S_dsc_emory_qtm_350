Students may complete these quizzes either during or after class, but must submit them by 11:59 p.m. on the lecture day. To accommodate the learning process, the lowest two quiz scores will be excluded from the final grade calculation. While individual submission is mandatory, collaborative discussions are encouraged. Please note that no extensions for quiz submissions will be granted under any circumstances, ensuring fairness and consistency in assessment for all students.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nProblem sets aligned with each topic will be assigned to solidify and apply the concepts covered. These sets are to be collaboratively developed in groups of up to three members, emphasizing the importance of code collaboration. Consequently, individual submissions will not be accepted. The primary objective of these problem sets is to provide a practical application of the content discussed during the semester. Assignments will be distributed via Canvas and/or GitHub, and may be formatted as either a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or Quarto documents (.qmd). Groups will be required to submit the complete source code of their assignments (.ipynb or .qmd). Each problem set will be meticulously evaluated, with grading based on both the accuracy and the overall quality of the work submitted. For instance, you must guarantee:\n\nAll code must run;\nEach problem set material will have its own GitHub repository;\nReadable Solutions: To facilitate effective evaluation and comprehension of the coding assignments, students must adhere to the following standards for code readability:\n\nComprehensive Commenting: All code must include thorough comments. These comments are essential as they allow the Professor and Teaching Assistants to understand the purpose and functionality of the code solely through these annotations. It is crucial that the comments are clear and concise, providing insight into the logic and purpose behind each segment of code.\n\n\nStructured Code Segmentation: Solutions should be methodically organized into distinct code chunks within Jupyter or R Markdown notebooks. For clarity on this format, refer to examples provided in class or consult with the Professor or Teaching Assistants.\n\n\nDetailed Documentation of Functions: Every function defined by a student must be accompanied by a docstring. This documentation should clearly explain the function’s purpose, describe each input argument, and outline what the function returns.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Project\nAt the heart of Data Science lies the critical skill of managing data effectively. This encompasses the ability to collect, organize, retrieve, filter, sort, and prepare data, forming the foundational steps before embarking on any comprehensive analysis. This project is your opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in applying the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course. In groups up to three members, you will be expected to showcase your competence in handling and preparing data for insightful analysis. Through this project, you will apply the principles and methodologies covered in the course.\n\nFinal Project Proposal\nEach group is required to submit a concise, yet comprehensive, two-page proposal outlining their intended project. This proposal is a crucial step in ensuring the viability and academic rigor of your planned research. Prior to its development, it is mandatory for each group to arrange a 15-minute consultation meeting with me. This meeting is intended to provide guidance, clarify objectives, and ensure alignment with course goals. To make the most of this consultation, groups must submit a draft of their project ideas in advance of the meeting. Please note that these consultation meetings will be scheduled during Week 10. It is imperative to adhere to this timeline to ensure timely feedback and guidance on your proposals.\n\n\nFinal Project Submission\nStudents are provided with two distinct opportunities to submit their final projects. The first submission is madatory for all groups and must be completed before the start of the presentation week. This phase allows for a preliminary assessment of your project. The subsequent submission is optional and should occur by the course’s last date. This opportunity is particularly beneficial for incorporating improvements based on peer review feedback received after the first submission. The final deliverable should be a comprehensive GitHub repository and a .zip file encompassing the following components: - Raw Source Data: Include the raw data utilized for your project. If the data file size exceeds GitHub’s limitations, it should be exclusively contained within the .zip file. - Detailed README: Your repository should contain a README file providing an in-depth description of each included file, covering: - Inputs: Detail the inputs to each file, such as raw data or files containing credentials for API access. - Functionality: Clearly describe the major transformations and operations performed by the file. - Outputs: Enumerate any outputs generated by the file (e.g. cleaned datasets). - Data Transformation and Organization Code: Submit all code files that are used to transform and organize your data. - Data Query for Analysis: Provide the set of code files that query your dataset, rendering it suitable for addressing your chosen data analysis question.\nFurther details and specific requirements will be shared before Week 10 of the course.\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation\nDuring the final week of the course, each group will have a 10 to 15-minute time slot to present their project. This presentation is a vital component of your project, providing an opportunity to showcase the depth of your analysis, the insights gained, and the skills acquired throughout the course. The scheduling of presentations will be randomly defined. Specific dates and the order of presentations for each group will be assigned and communicated in advance.\nFurther details and specific requirements will be shared before Week 13 of the course.\n\n\n\nPeer Review\nIn the week of presentations, your active participation in the peer review process will be essential. Each student is expected to engage constructively in evaluating and providing feedback on their colleagues’ projects. You will be asked to thoughtfully comment on various aspects of the projects, including methodology, data structure, presentation features, and the overall effectiveness of the conveyed message. This exercise is not only a crucial part of your learning experience but also an opportunity to contribute to the academic development of your peers."

    "text": "Communication\n\nCheck the Course Website and Canvas Page regularly to keep yourself informed with up-to-date information about the course. Also, be sure to check the course syllabus before asking any questions about the course schedule/policies.\nIf you cannot attend the office hours due to conflicts with other course schedule or attending the university-sanctioned events (proof required), email the instructor at least two days in advance to set up an appointment. Note that each appointment will be 15-minutes long, and it may be done in a small group or individually. No appointments will be allowed nearing the exam dates.\nWhen attending virtual office hours, make sure you are in a private setting with a little to no background noise. The use of headphones is strongly encouraged. This is especially true when you are discussing private matters with the instructor.\nDo not use email for asking content-related questions, and do not use Canvas messages.\nDo not email me your private stories. Keep your email brief, and you will receive a response from me within 48 hours, except for the weekends. Similarly, if you receive an email from me, you are also expected to respond within 48 hours. Set up an individual appointment to discuss such things.\nFinally, if you are experiencing situations that negatively impact your overall student life, you should immediately contact the Office of Undergraduate Education."

First, review the missed materials, then you may attend the instructor office hours to ask specific questions.\nAttendance is not monitored in lecture except on the exam dates.\nEmory College of Arts and Sciences policy states, “A student who fails to take any required midterm or final examination at the scheduled time may not make up the examination without written permission from a dean in the Office for Undergraduate Education. Permission will be granted only for illness or other compelling reasons, such as participation in scheduled events off-campus as an official representative of the University."

Students who receive accommodations must contact the instructor with an Accommodation Letter from the DAS at the beginning of the semester, or as soon as the accommodation is granted. If you have DAS accommodations, you must inform the instructor after confirming that your accommodation letter is available in the DAS web portal. The instructor will respond to your email confirming which accommodations you will receive for this class. If you wish to do so, you may request an individual meeting to further discuss the specific accommodations."
