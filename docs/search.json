It also provides software resources.\nThe OS is divided into the kernel and user space.\nThe kernel is the core of the OS. It’s responsible for interfacing with hardware (drivers), managing resources etc. Running software in the kernel is extremely sensitive! That’s why users are kept away from it.\nThe user space provides an interface for users, who can run programs/applications on the machine. Hardware access of programs (e.g., memory usage) is managed by the kernel. Programs in user space are essentially in sandboxes, which sets a limit to how much damage they can do."

This could be interactively, by typing at a terminal, or via scripts, which are files that contain a sequence of commands.\nModern computers use graphical user interfaces (GUIs) as the standard tool for human-computer interaction.\nWhy “kernel” and “shell”? The kernel is the soft, edible part of a nut or seed, which is surrounded by a shell to protect it. Useful metaphor, no?"

Back in the old days (even before computer screen existed), terminal machines (hardware!) were used to let humans interface with large machines (“mainframes”). Often many terminals were connected to a single machine.\nWhen you want to work with a computer in a data center (or remotely ~ cloud computing), you’ll still do pretty much the same."

Typing commands is generally much faster than exploring through user interfaces with a mouse.\nPower. Both for executing commands and for fixing problems. There are some things you just can’t do in an IDE or GUI. It also avoids memory complications associated with certain applications and/or IDEs.\nReproducibility. Scripting is reproducible, while clicking is not.\nPortability. A shell can be used to interface to almost any type of computer, from a mainframe to a Raspberry Pi, in a very similar way. The shell is often the only game in town for high performance computing (interacting with servers and super computers).\nAutomation. Shells are programmable: Working in the shell allows you to program workflows, that is create scripts to automate time-consuming or repetitive processes.\nBecome a marketable data scientist. Modern programming is often polyglot. The shell provides a common interface for tooling. Modern solutions are often built to run in containers on Linux. In this environment shell knowledge has become very valuable. In short, the shell is having a renaissance in the age of data science."

This\n             option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-C\bC      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to\n             a terminal.\n\n     -\b-D\bD _\bf_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt\n             When printing in the long (-\b-l\bl) format, use _\bf_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt to format the\n             date and time output.  The argument _\bf_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt is a string used by\n             strftime(3).  Depending on the choice of format string, this may\n             result in a different number of columns in the output.  This\n             option overrides the -\b-T\bT option.  This option is not defined in\n             IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-F\bF      Display a slash (‘/’) immediately after each pathname that is a\n             directory, an asterisk (‘*’) after each that is executable, an at\n             sign (‘@’) after each symbolic link, an equals sign (‘=’) after\n             each socket, a percent sign (‘%’) after each whiteout, and a\n             vertical bar (‘|’) after each that is a FIFO.\n\n     -\b-G\bG      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining\n             CLICOLOR or COLORTERM in the environment and setting\n             -\b--\b-c\bco\bol\blo\bor\br=_\ba_\bu_\bt_\bo.  (See below.)  This functionality can be compiled\n             out by removing the definition of COLORLS.  This option is not\n             defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-H\bH      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  This option is\n             assumed if none of the -\b-F\bF, -\b-d\bd, or -\b-l\bl options are specified.\n\n     -\b-I\bI      Prevent -\b-A\bA from being automatically set for the super-user.  This\n             option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-L\bL      Follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or\n             directory the link references rather than the link itself.  This\n             option cancels the -\b-P\bP option.\n\n     -\b-O\bO      Include the file flags in a long (-\b-l\bl) output.  This option is\n             incompatible with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).  See\n             chflags(1) for a list of file flags and their meanings.\n\n     -\b-P\bP      If argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than\n             the object the link references.  This option cancels the -\b-H\bH and\n             -\b-L\bL options.\n\n     -\b-R\bR      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.\n\n     -\b-S\bS      Sort by size (largest file first) before sorting the operands in\n             lexicographical order.\n\n     -\b-T\bT      When printing in the long (-\b-l\bl) format, display complete time\n             information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute,\n             second, and year.  The -\b-D\bD option gives even more control over the\n             output format.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std\n             1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-U\bU      Use time when file was created for sorting or printing.  This\n             option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-W\bW      Display whiteouts when scanning directories.  This option is not\n             defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-a\ba      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘_\b.’).\n\n     -\b-b\bb      As -\b-B\bB, but use C escape codes whenever possible.  This option is\n             not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-c\bc      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or\n             printing.\n\n     -\b--\b-c\bco\bol\blo\bor\br=_\bw_\bh_\be_\bn\n             Output colored escape sequences based on _\bw_\bh_\be_\bn, which may be set\n             to either a\bal\blw\bwa\bay\bys\bs, a\bau\but\bto\bo, or n\bne\bev\bve\ber\br.\n\n             a\bal\blw\bwa\bay\bys\bs will make l\bls\bs always output color.  If TERM is unset or set\n             to an invalid terminal, then l\bls\bs will fall back to explicit ANSI\n             escape sequences without the help of termcap(5).  a\bal\blw\bwa\bay\bys\bs is the\n             default if -\b--\b-c\bco\bol\blo\bor\br is specified without an argument.\n\n             a\bau\but\bto\bo will make l\bls\bs output escape sequences based on termcap(5),\n             but only if stdout is a tty and either the -\b-G\bG flag is specified\n             or the COLORTERM environment variable is set and not empty.\n\n             n\bne\bev\bve\ber\br will disable color regardless of environment variables.\n             n\bne\bev\bve\ber\br is the default when neither -\b--\b-c\bco\bol\blo\bor\br nor -\b-G\bG is specified.\n\n             For compatibility with GNU coreutils, l\bls\bs supports y\bye\bes\bs or f\bfo\bor\brc\bce\be as\n             equivalent to a\bal\blw\bwa\bay\bys\bs, n\bno\bo or n\bno\bon\bne\be as equivalent to n\bne\bev\bve\ber\br, and t\btt\bty\by\n             or i\bif\bf-\b-t\btt\bty\by as equivalent to a\bau\but\bto\bo.\n\n     -\b-d\bd      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).\n\n     -\b-e\be      Print the Access Control List (ACL) associated with the file, if\n             present, in long (-\b-l\bl) output.\n\n     -\b-f\bf      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on -\b-a\ba.  It also negates\n             the effect of the -\b-r\br, -\b-S\bS and -\b-t\bt options.  As allowed by IEEE Std\n             1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”), this option has no effect on the -\b-d\bd, -\b-l\bl,\n             -\b-R\bR and -\b-s\bs options.\n\n     -\b-g\bg      This option has no effect.  It is only available for\n             compatibility with 4.3BSD, where it was used to display the group\n             name in the long (-\b-l\bl) format output.  This option is incompatible\n             with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-h\bh      When used with the -\b-l\bl option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,\n             Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the\n             number of digits to four or fewer using base 2 for sizes.  This\n             option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-i\bi      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode\n             number).\n\n     -\b-k\bk      This has the same effect as setting environment variable\n             BLOCKSIZE to 1024, except that it also nullifies any -\b-h\bh options\n             to its left.\n\n     -\b-l\bl      (The lowercase letter “ell”.) List files in the long format, as\n             described in the _\bT_\bh_\be _\bL_\bo_\bn_\bg _\bF_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt subsection below.\n\n     -\b-m\bm      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by\n             commas.\n\n     -\b-n\bn      Display user and group IDs numerically rather than converting to\n             a user or group name in a long (-\b-l\bl) output.  This option turns on\n             the -\b-l\bl option.\n\n     -\b-o\bo      List in long format, but omit the group id.\n\n     -\b-p\bp      Write a slash (‘/’) after each filename if that file is a\n             directory.\n\n     -\b-q\bq      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the\n             character ‘?’; this is the default when output is to a terminal.\n\n     -\b-r\br      Reverse the order of the sort.\n\n     -\b-s\bs      Display the number of blocks used in the file system by each\n             file.  Block sizes and directory totals are handled as described\n             in _\bT_\bh_\be _\bL_\bo_\bn_\bg _\bF_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt subsection below, except (if the long format\n             is not also requested) the directory totals are not output when\n             the output is in a single column, even if multi-column output is\n             requested.  (-\b-l\bl) format, display complete time information for\n             the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.\n             The -\b-D\bD option gives even more control over the output format.\n             This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-t\bt      Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).\n             If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort their\n             names in ascending lexicographical order.  The -\b-r\br option reverses\n             both of these sort orders.\n\n             Note that these sort orders are contradictory: the time sequence\n             is in descending order, the lexicographical sort is in ascending\n             order.  This behavior is mandated by IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).\n             This feature can cause problems listing files stored with\n             sequential names on FAT file systems, such as from digital\n             cameras, where it is possible to have more than one image with\n             the same timestamp.  In such a case, the photos cannot be listed\n             in the sequence in which they were taken.  To ensure the same\n             sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting, set the\n             environment variable LS_SAMESORT or use the -\b-y\by option.  This\n             causes l\bls\bs to reverse the lexicographical sort order when sorting\n             files with the same modification timestamp.\n\n     -\b-u\bu      Use time of last access, instead of time of last modification of\n             the file for sorting (-\b-t\bt) or long printing (-\b-l\bl).\n\n     -\b-v\bv      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters; this is the\n             default when output is not to a terminal.\n\n     -\b-w\bw      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the\n             default when output is not to a terminal.  This option is not\n             defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-x\bx      The same as -\b-C\bC, except that the multi-column output is produced\n             with entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns.\n\n     -\b-y\by      When the -\b-t\bt option is set, sort the alphabetical output in the\n             same order as the time output.  This has the same effect as\n             setting LS_SAMESORT.  See the description of the -\b-t\bt option for\n             more details.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001\n             (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-%\b%      Distinguish dataless files and directories with a '%' character\n             in long (-\b-l\bl) output, and don't materialize dataless directories\n             when listing them.\n\n     -\b-1\b1      (The numeric digit “one”.) Force output to be one entry per line.\n             This is the default when output is not to a terminal.\n\n     -\b-,      (Comma) When the -\b-l\bl option is set, print file sizes grouped and\n             separated by thousands using the non-monetary separator returned\n             by localeconv(3), typically a comma or period.  If no locale is\n             set, or the locale does not have a non-monetary separator, this\n             option has no effect.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std\n             1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     The -\b-1\b1, -\b-C\bC, -\b-x\bx, and -\b-l\bl options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the format used.\n\n     The -\b-c\bc, -\b-u\bu, and -\b-U\bU options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the file time used.\n\n     The -\b-S\bS and -\b-t\bt options override each other; the last one specified\n     determines the sort order used.\n\n     The -\b-B\bB, -\b-b\bb, -\b-w\bw, and -\b-q\bq options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the format used for non-printable characters.\n\n     The -\b-H\bH, -\b-L\bL and -\b-P\bP options all override each other (either partially or\n     fully); they are applied in the order specified.\n\n     By default, l\bls\bs lists one entry per line to standard output; the\n     exceptions are to terminals or when the -\b-C\bC or -\b-x\bx options are specified.\n\n     File information is displayed with one or more ⟨blank⟩s separating the\n     information associated with the -\b-i\bi, -\b-s\bs, and -\b-l\bl options.\n\n   T\bTh\bhe\be L\bLo\bon\bng\bg F\bFo\bor\brm\bma\bat\bt\n     If the -\b-l\bl option is given, the following information is displayed for\n     each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of\n     bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last\n     modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the\n     pathname.  If the file or directory has extended attributes, the\n     permissions field printed by the -\b-l\bl option is followed by a '@'\n     character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security\n     information (such as an access control list), the permissions field\n     printed by the -\b-l\bl option is followed by a '+' character.  If the -\b-%\b%\n     option is given, a '%' character follows the permissions field for\n     dataless files and directories, possibly replacing the '@' or '+'\n     character.\n\n     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or\n     future, and the -\b-D\bD or -\b-T\bT are not specified, then the year of the last\n     modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.\n\n     If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -\b-n\bn\n     option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed.\n\n     If the file is a character special or block special file, the device\n     number for the file is displayed in the size field.  If the file is a\n     symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by “-&gt;”.\n\n     The listing of a directory's contents is preceded by a labeled total\n     number of blocks used in the file system by the files which are listed as\n     the directory's contents (which may or may not include _\b. and _\b._\b. and other\n     files which start with a dot, depending on other options).\n\n     The default block size is 512 bytes.  The block size may be set with\n     option -\b-k\bk or environment variable BLOCKSIZE.  Numbers of blocks in the\n     output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is at least as\n     many as used by the corresponding file system blocks (which might have a\n     different size).\n\n     The file mode printed under the -\b-l\bl option consists of the entry type and\n     the permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file, as\n     follows:\n\n           -\b-     Regular file.\n           b\bb     Block special file.\n           c\bc     Character special file.\n           d\bd     Directory.\n           l\bl     Symbolic link.\n           p\bp     FIFO.\n           s\bs     Socket.\n           w\bw     Whiteout.\n\n     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group\n     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character\n     positions:\n\n           1.   If r\br, the file is readable; if -\b-, it is not readable.\n\n           2.   If w\bw, the file is writable; if -\b-, it is not writable.\n\n           3.   The first of the following that applies:\n\n                      S\bS     If in the owner permissions, the file is not\n                            executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the\n                            group permissions, the file is not executable and\n                            set-group-ID mode is set.\n\n                      s\bs     If in the owner permissions, the file is\n                            executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the\n                            group permissions, the file is executable and\n                            setgroup-ID mode is set.\n\n                      x\bx     The file is executable or the directory is\n                            searchable.\n\n                      -\b-     The file is neither readable, writable,\n                            executable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode,\n                            nor sticky.  (See below.)\n\n                These next two apply only to the third character in the last\n                group (other permissions).\n\n                      T\bT     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute\n                            or search permission.  (See chmod(1) or\n                            sticky(7).)\n\n                      t\bt     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is\n                            searchable or executable.  (See chmod(1) or\n                            sticky(7).)\n\n     The next field contains a plus (‘+’) character if the file has an ACL, or\n     a space (‘ ’) if it does not.  The l\bls\bs utility does not show the actual\n     ACL unless the -\b-e\be option is used in conjunction with the -\b-l\bl option.\n\nE\bEN\bNV\bVI\bIR\bRO\bON\bNM\bME\bEN\bNT\bT\n     The following environment variables affect the execution of l\bls\bs:\n\n     BLOCKSIZE           If this is set, its value, rounded up to 512 or down\n                         to a multiple of 512, will be used as the block size\n                         in bytes by the -\b-l\bl and -\b-s\bs options.  See _\bT_\bh_\be _\bL_\bo_\bn_\bg\n                         _\bF_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt subsection for more information.\n\n     CLICOLOR            Use ANSI color sequences to distinguish file types.\n                         See LSCOLORS below.  In addition to the file types\n                         mentioned in the -\b-F\bF option some extra attributes\n                         (setuid bit set, etc.) are also displayed.  The\n                         colorization is dependent on a terminal type with the\n                         proper termcap(5) capabilities.  The default “cons25”\n                         console has the proper capabilities, but to display\n                         the colors in an xterm(1), for example, the TERM\n                         variable must be set to “xterm-color”.  Other\n                         terminal types may require similar adjustments.\n                         Colorization is silently disabled if the output is\n                         not directed to a terminal unless the CLICOLOR_FORCE\n                         variable is defined or -\b--\b-c\bco\bol\blo\bor\br is set to “always”.\n\n     CLICOLOR_FORCE      Color sequences are normally disabled if the output\n                         is not directed to a terminal.  This can be\n                         overridden by setting this variable.  The TERM\n                         variable still needs to reference a color capable\n                         terminal however otherwise it is not possible to\n                         determine which color sequences to use.\n\n     COLORTERM           See description for CLICOLOR above.\n\n     COLUMNS             If this variable contains a string representing a\n                         decimal integer, it is used as the column position\n                         width for displaying multiple-text-column output.\n                         The l\bls\bs utility calculates how many pathname text\n                         columns to display based on the width provided.  (See\n                         -\b-C\bC and -\b-x\bx.)\n\n     LANG                The locale to use when determining the order of day\n                         and month in the long -\b-l\bl format output.  See\n                         environ(7) for more information.\n\n     LSCOLORS            The value of this variable describes what color to\n                         use for which attribute when colors are enabled with\n                         CLICOLOR or COLORTERM.  This string is a\n                         concatenation of pairs of the format _\bf_\bb, where _\bf is\n                         the foreground color and _\bb is the background color.\n\n                         The color designators are as follows:\n\n                               a\ba     black\n                               b\bb     red\n                               c\bc     green\n                               d\bd     brown\n                               e\be     blue\n                               f\bf     magenta\n                               g\bg     cyan\n                               h\bh     light grey\n                               A\bA     bold black, usually shows up as dark grey\n                               B\bB     bold red\n                               C\bC     bold green\n                               D\bD     bold brown, usually shows up as yellow\n                               E\bE     bold blue\n                               F\bF     bold magenta\n                               G\bG     bold cyan\n                               H\bH     bold light grey; looks like bright white\n                               x\bx     default foreground or background\n\n                         Note that the above are standard ANSI colors.

This file presumably contains sonnets or other text.\n\n\n\n\n2&gt;/dev/null\n\n2&gt; is used to redirect the standard error (stderr) output stream.\n/dev/null is a special file that discards all data written to it.\nThis redirection sends all error messages from cat (like file not found, no read permission, etc.) to /dev/null, effectively silencing any errors that cat might produce.\n\n| head -n100\n\nThe pipe | passes the output of the previous command (cat -n) to the next command as input.\nhead is used to output the first part of files.\nThe -n100 option tells head to print the first 100 lines of its input.\n\n| tail -n10\n\nAnother pipe | passes the output of head -n100 to the next command as input.\ntail outputs the last part of files.\nThe -n10 option tells tail to print the last 10 lines of its input."

Let’s cover some of the installation steps here:\nTo install RStudio, download from the following link. reticulate is a R package that allows one run a Python REPL in the R console. In addition, it allows one to read in and use Python code, and pass data between R and Python. The following provides instructions on installing reticulate.\nWith reticulate, you can use Rstudio as a IDE for Python. Another option is to use Quarto (the next-generation version of R Markdown) as an unified framework to generate notebooks with text + code. If you are an R Markdown user, you will see how Quarto is just an extension of the capabilities that were previously provided by R Markdown. Now, instead of .rmd files, we have .qmd files.

Students may complete these quizzes either during or after class, the due dates will be posted in the course canvas page. To accommodate the learning process, the lowest two quizzes scores will be excluded from the final grade calculation. While individual submission is mandatory, collaborative discussions are encouraged. Please note that no extensions will be granted under any circumstances, ensuring fairness and consistency in assessment for all students.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nProblem sets aligned with each topic will be assigned to solidify and apply the concepts covered. These sets are to be collaboratively developed in groups of up to three members, emphasizing the importance of code collaboration. Consequently, individual submissions will not be accepted. Assignments will be distributed via Canvas and/or GitHub, and may be formatted as either a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), Quarto documents (.qmd), or HTML (.html). Groups will be required to submit the complete source code of their assignments (.ipynb, .qmd, or .html). Each problem set will be meticulously evaluated, with grading based on both the accuracy and the overall quality of the work submitted. For instance, you must guarantee:\n\nAll code must run;\nEach problem set material will have its own GitHub repository;\nReadable Solutions: To facilitate effective evaluation and comprehension of the coding assignments, students must adhere to the following standards for code readability:\n\nComprehensive Commenting: All code must include thorough comments. These comments are essential as they allow the Professor and Teaching Assistants to understand the purpose and functionality of the code solely through these annotations. It is crucial that the comments are clear and concise, providing insight into the logic and purpose behind each segment of code.\n\n\nStructured Code Segmentation: Solutions should be methodically organized into distinct code chunks within Jupyter or R Markdown notebooks. For clarity on this format, refer to examples provided in class or consult with the Professor or Teaching Assistants.\n\n\nDetailed Documentation of Functions: Every function defined by a student must be accompanied by a docstring. This documentation should clearly explain the function’s purpose, describe each input argument, and outline what the function returns.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Project\nAt the heart of Data Science lies the critical skill of managing data effectively. This encompasses the ability to collect, organize, retrieve, filter, sort, and prepare data, forming the foundational steps before embarking on any comprehensive analysis. This project is your opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in applying the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course. In groups up to three members, you will be expected to showcase your competence in handling and preparing data for insightful analysis. Through this project, you will apply the principles and methodologies covered in the course.\n\nFinal Project Proposal\nEach group is required to submit a concise, yet comprehensive, two-page proposal outlining their intended project. This proposal is a crucial step in ensuring the viability and academic rigor of your planned research. Prior to its development, it is mandatory for each group to arrange a 15-minute consultation meeting with me. This meeting is intended to provide guidance, clarify objectives, and ensure alignment with course goals. To make the most of this consultation, groups must submit a draft of their project ideas in advance of the meeting. Please note that these consultation meetings will be scheduled during Week 10. It is imperative to adhere to this timeline to ensure timely feedback and guidance on your proposals.\n\n\nFinal Project Submission\nStudents are provided with two distinct opportunities to submit their final projects. The first submission is madatory for all groups and must be completed before the start of the presentation week. This phase allows for a preliminary assessment of your project. The subsequent submission is optional and should occur by the course’s last date. This opportunity is particularly beneficial for incorporating improvements based on peer review feedback received after the first submission. The final deliverable should be a comprehensive GitHub repository and a .zip file encompassing the following components:\n\nRaw Source Data: Include the raw data utilized for your project. If the data file size exceeds GitHub’s limitations, it should be exclusively contained within the .zip file.\nDetailed README: Your repository should contain a README file providing an in-depth description of each included file, covering:\n\nInputs: Detail the inputs to each file, such as raw data or files containing credentials for API access.\nFunctionality: Clearly describe the major transformations and operations performed by the file.\nOutputs: Enumerate any outputs generated by the file (e.g. cleaned datasets).\n\nData Transformation and Organization Code: Submit all code files that are used to transform and organize your data.\nData Query for Analysis: Provide the set of code files that query your dataset, rendering it suitable for addressing your chosen data analysis question.\n\nFurther details and specific requirements will be shared before Week 10 of the course.\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation\nDuring the final week of the course, each group will have a 10 to 15-minute time slot to present their project. This presentation is a vital component of your project, providing an opportunity to showcase the depth of your analysis, the insights gained, and the skills acquired throughout the course. The scheduling of presentations will be randomly defined. Specific dates and the order of presentations for each group will be assigned and communicated in advance.\nFurther details and specific requirements will be shared before Week 13 of the course.\n\n\n\nPeer Review\nIn the week of presentations, your active participation in the peer review process will be essential. Each student is expected to engage constructively in evaluating and providing feedback on their colleagues’ projects. You will be asked to thoughtfully comment on various aspects of the projects, including methodology, data structure, presentation features, and the overall effectiveness of the conveyed message. This exercise is not only a crucial part of your learning experience but also an opportunity to contribute to the academic development of your peers.",

Academic misconduct is an offense generally defined as any action or inaction which is offensive to the integrity and honesty of the members of the academic community. The typical sanction for a violation of the Emory Honor Code is an F in the course. Any suspected case of academic misconduct will be referred to the Emory Honor Council.",

Also, be sure to check the course syllabus before asking any questions about the course schedule/policies.\nIf you cannot attend the office hours due to conflicts with other course schedule or attending the university-sanctioned events (proof required), email the instructor at least two days in advance to set up an appointment. Note that each appointment will be 15-minutes long, and it may be done in a small group or individually. No appointments will be allowed nearing the exam dates.\nWhen attending virtual office hours, make sure you are in a private setting with a little to no background noise. The use of headphones is strongly encouraged. This is especially true when you are discussing private matters with the instructor.\nDo not use email for asking content-related questions, and do not use Canvas messages.\nDo not email me your private stories. Keep your email brief, and you will receive a response from me within 48 hours, except for the weekends. Similarly, if you receive an email from me, you are also expected to respond within 48 hours. Set up an individual appointment to discuss such things.\nFinally, if you are experiencing situations that negatively impact your overall student life, you should immediately contact the Office of Undergraduate Education.",
