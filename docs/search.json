    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nFinal grades will be based on:\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nLecture Quizzes\n10%\n\n\nProblem Sets\n40%\n\n\nFinal Project Proposal\n5%\n\n\nFinal Project Submission\n25%\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation\n10%\n\n\nPeer Review\n10%\n\n\n\n\nLecture Quizzes\nEach lecture will be accompanied by a set of questions, available on the course’s Canvas page and to be completed individually. Students may complete these quizzes either during or after class, but must submit them by 11:59 p.m. on the lecture day. To accommodate the learning process, the lowest two quiz scores will be excluded from the final grade calculation. While individual submission is mandatory, collaborative discussions are encouraged. Please note that no extensions for quiz submissions will be granted under any circumstances, ensuring fairness and consistency in assessment for all students.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nProblem sets aligned with each topic will be assigned to solidify and apply the concepts covered. These sets are to be collaboratively developed in groups of up to three members, emphasizing the importance of code collaboration. Consequently, individual submissions will not be accepted. The primary objective of these problem sets is to provide a practical application of the content discussed during the semester. Assignments will be distributed via Canvas and/or GitHub, and may be formatted as either a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or Quarto documents (.qmd). Groups will be required to submit the complete source code of their assignments (.ipynb or .qmd). Each problem set will be meticulously evaluated, with grading based on both the accuracy and the overall quality of the work submitted. For instance, you must guarantee:\n\nAll code must run;\nEach problem set material will have its own GitHub repository;\nReadable Solutions: To facilitate effective evaluation and comprehension of the coding assignments, students must adhere to the following standards for code readability:\n\nComprehensive Commenting: All code must include thorough comments. These comments are essential as they allow the Professor and Teaching Assistants to understand the purpose and functionality of the code solely through these annotations. It is crucial that the comments are clear and concise, providing insight into the logic and purpose behind each segment of code.\n\n\nStructured Code Segmentation: Solutions should be methodically organized into distinct code chunks within Jupyter or R Markdown notebooks. For clarity on this format, refer to examples provided in class or consult with the Professor or Teaching Assistants.\n\n\nDetailed Documentation of Functions: Every function defined by a student must be accompanied by a docstring. This documentation should clearly explain the function’s purpose, describe each input argument, and outline what the function returns.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Project\nAt the heart of Data Science lies the critical skill of managing data effectively. This encompasses the ability to collect, organize, retrieve, filter, sort, and prepare data, forming the foundational steps before embarking on any comprehensive analysis. This project is your opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in applying the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course. In groups up to three members, you will be expected to showcase your competence in handling and preparing data for insightful analysis. Through this project, you will apply the principles and methodologies covered in the course.\n\nFinal Project Proposal\nEach group is required to submit a concise, yet comprehensive, two-page proposal outlining their intended project. This proposal is a crucial step in ensuring the viability and academic rigor of your planned research. Prior to its development, it is mandatory for each group to arrange a 15-minute consultation meeting with me. This meeting is intended to provide guidance, clarify objectives, and ensure alignment with course goals. To make the most of this consultation, groups must submit a draft of their project ideas in advance of the meeting. Please note that these consultation meetings will be scheduled during Week 10. It is imperative to adhere to this timeline to ensure timely feedback and guidance on your proposals.\n\n\nFinal Project Submission\nStudents are provided with two distinct opportunities to submit their final projects. The first submission is madatory for all groups and must be completed before the start of the presentation week. This phase allows for a preliminary assessment of your project. The subsequent submission is optional and should occur by the course’s last date. This opportunity is particularly beneficial for incorporating improvements based on peer review feedback received after the first submission. The final deliverable should be a comprehensive GitHub repository and a .zip file encompassing the following components:\n\nRaw Source Data: Include the raw data utilized for your project. If the data file size exceeds GitHub’s limitations, it should be exclusively contained within the .zip file.\nDetailed README: Your repository should contain a README file providing an in-depth description of each included file, covering:\n\nInputs: Detail the inputs to each file, such as raw data or files containing credentials for API access.\nFunctionality: Clearly describe the major transformations and operations performed by the file.\nOutputs: Enumerate any outputs generated by the file (e.g. cleaned datasets).\n\nData Transformation and Organization Code: Submit all code files that are used to transform and organize your data.\nData Query for Analysis: Provide the set of code files that query your dataset, rendering it suitable for addressing your chosen data analysis question.\n\nFurther details and specific requirements will be shared before Week 10 of the course.\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation\nDuring the final week of the course, each group will have a 10 to 15-minute time slot to present their project. This presentation is a vital component of your project, providing an opportunity to showcase the depth of your analysis, the insights gained, and the skills acquired throughout the course. The scheduling of presentations will be randomly defined. Specific dates and the order of presentations for each group will be assigned and communicated in advance.\nFurther details and specific requirements will be shared before Week 13 of the course.\n\n\n\nPeer Review\nIn the week of presentations, your active participation in the peer review process will be essential. Each student is expected to engage constructively in evaluating and providing feedback on their colleagues’ projects. You will be asked to thoughtfully comment on various aspects of the projects, including methodology, data structure, presentation features, and the overall effectiveness of the conveyed message. This exercise is not only a crucial part of your learning experience but also an opportunity to contribute to the academic development of your peers."

    "text": "Quick tutorial for RStudio\nThis is what RStudio looks like when you open it for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop left pane (input/script)\nThis is your code editor. Here you enter code in any file type (.py, .r, .qmd) you are working on. If not working with notebooks, this is just gonna be a plain text file but with a extension that run the commands.\nFor example, enter 2 + 2 in your script and run a line of code by pressing command + enter (Mac) or Ctrl + enter (PC). This is a huge advantage of Rstudio over Jupyter. You can run your code line by line, instead of running the entire cell.\nBottom left pane (output/console)\nThis is the console. It is pretty much like when you open Python/R from the Command line.\nIn the console, the prompt &gt; looks like a greater than symbol. If your prompt begins to look like a + symbol by mistake, simply click in your console and press the esc key on your keyboard as many times as necessary to return to the prompt.\nRstudio uses + when code is broken up across multiple lines and is still expecting more code. A line of code does not usually end until Rstudio finds an appropriate stop parameter or punctuation that completes some code such as a closed round parenthesis ), square bracket ], curly brace }, or quotation mark '.\nIf the output in your console gets too messy, you can clear it by pressing control + l on both Mac and PC. This will not erase any saved data - it will simply make your console easier to read.\nTop right pane (global environment)\nThis is your environment pane. All objects you create will be displayed here.\nBottom right pane (files, plots, packages, and help)\nHere you find useful tabs for navigating your file system, displaying plots, installing packages, and viewing help pages. Press the control key and a number (1 through 9) on your keyboard to shortcut between these panes and tabs."

It can handle a number of different languages. We can use Python in RStudio using the reticulate package.\nCheck the intro to quarto notebook on how to use Python in Rstudio. Let’s cover some of the installation steps here:\nTo install RStudio, download from the following link. reticulate is a R package that allows one run a Python REPL in the R console. In addition, it allows one to read in and use Python code, and pass data between R and Python. The following provides instructions on installing reticulate.\nWith reticulate, you can use Rstudio as a IDE for Python. Another option is to use Quarto (the next-generation version of R Markdown) as an unified framework to generate notebooks with text + code. If you are an R Markdown user, you will see how Quarto is just an extension of the capabilities that were previously provided by R Markdown. Now, instead of .rmd files, we have .qmd files. Quarto is already installed with RStudio."
