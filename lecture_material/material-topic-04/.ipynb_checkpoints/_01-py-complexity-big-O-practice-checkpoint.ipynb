    "**Sample Answer**: The time complexity of `example` is  $O(n)$ because the function loops over $n$ elements and only performs constant-time operations inside the loop. \n",

    "**Details**: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function contains a `for` loop that runs `n` times. \n",
    "2. Within this loop, two operations occur:\n",
    "   - `print(i)` which is a constant-time operation, \\(O(1)\\).\n",
    "   - `print(i**2)` which is also a constant-time operation, \\(O(1)\\), as the squaring of a number is a simple arithmetic operation that doesn't depend on the size of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two operations inside the loop do not alter the overall number of iterations and are independent of each other, hence, they do not multiply the complexity.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Since all operations inside the loop are \\(O(1)\\) and the loop runs `n` times, the total time complexity of the function is determined by the loop. \n",

    "Therefore, the time complexity of the function `example(n)` is linear, \\(O(n)\\), where `n` is the size of the input. The two constant-time assignments outside the loop do not change the overall complexity because constant factors and lower-order terms are not considered in big-O notation."

    "1. An outer loop that runs `n` times, with its index `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.\n",
    "2. An inner loop that depends on the current iteration of the outer loop, running `i` times, which means it runs a variable number of times depending on the value of `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of iterations for the inner loop starts at 0 (when `i` is 0) and increases by one each time the outer loop increments. This creates a series of iterations that resembles the sum of the first `n` integers, which can be calculated by the formula \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this sum is \\(O(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2})\\), but in big-O notation, we drop constants and non-dominant terms. Thus, the complexity simplifies to \\(O(n^2)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the difference from a typical \\(O(n^2)\\) loop, like the previous `loopy(n)` function, is that the inner loop does not always run `n` times. It runs fewer times in the early iterations and more times in the later iterations, approaching `n` only on the last iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while the complexity is still quadratic, \\(O(n^2)\\), it is important to note that the function `triangle(n)` is more efficient than a function with two fully nested loops each running `n` times, because the actual number of total operations here is roughly half that of a full \\(n \\times n\\) loop structure."
